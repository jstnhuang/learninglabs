Web Dev 101 learning labs

This is a set of purely educational projects in web development, including:
- Card maker
- Beepbox

Card maker is a simple Javascript application that shows how to use jQuery to
read in inputs and use that information to customize a greeting card.

Beepbox shows how to use PHP to read to and write from databases, how to perform
long-polling, how to use PHP in general, and more Javascript. It's a very small version of Twitter.
